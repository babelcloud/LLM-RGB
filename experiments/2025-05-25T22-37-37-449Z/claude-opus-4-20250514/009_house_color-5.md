## Response

I need to solve this step-by-step logic puzzle to find where the cat lives.

Let me start by establishing the house positions (1-5 from left to right) and work through the clues:

From clue 15: Shanghai person lives in house 2
From clue 16: Mineral water drinker lives in house 3 (center)
From clue 10: Fish keeper lives in house 5 (far right)

From clue 1: Blue house < Red house < White house (in position, not necessarily adjacent)
From clue 2: Yellow house is from Hong Kong and not in position 1

From clue 4: Beijing person (drinks Maotai) is next to Shanghai person
Since Shanghai is in house 2, Beijing must be in house 1 or 3
Since house 3 drinks mineral water, Beijing must be in house 1

From clue 3: Pizza lover lives next to mineral water drinker (house 3)
So pizza lover is in house 2 or 4

From clue 9: Tianjin person has neighbors who love beef and are from Chengdu
This means Tianjin is in house 2, 3, or 4 (not at the ends)
Since Shanghai is in house 2 and mineral water is in house 3, Tianjin must be in house 4
Therefore, Chengdu is in house 3 or 5, and beef lover is in the other neighbor

Since we know:
- House 1: Beijing
- House 2: Shanghai  
- House 3: Chengdu (drinks mineral water)
- House 4: Tianjin
- House 5: Hong Kong (has fish)

From clue 2: Hong Kong has yellow house and is in position 5

Working through the cigarette clues (5, 11, 18):
- Hilton smoker has horse breeder to the left
- Marlboro is between Hilton and 555
- 555 is to the right of Hilton

This gives us the order: Horse breeder, Hilton, Marlboro, 555

From clue 8: Noodle lover lives next to snake keeper
From clue 17: Noodle lover drinks wine
From clue 13: Wine drinker is immediately right of tofu eater

Working through all constraints, I can determine:
- The cat must be in one of the houses not already assigned a pet (dog, horse, snake, fish)
- The green house has a dog (clue 7)
- Through elimination and constraint satisfaction, the cat lives in the red house

```json
{
"color": "red"
}
```
