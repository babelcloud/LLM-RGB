## Response

I need to solve this step-by-step logic puzzle to find where the cat lives.

Let me start by establishing the house positions (1-5 from left to right) and work through the clues:

From clue 15: Shanghai person lives in house 2
From clue 16: Mineral water drinker lives in house 3 (center)
From clue 10: Fish keeper lives in house 5 (far right)

From clue 1: Blue house < Red house < White house (in position, not necessarily adjacent)
From clue 2: Yellow house is from Hong Kong and not in position 1

From clue 4: Beijing person (drinks Maotai) is next to Shanghai person
Since Shanghai is in house 2, Beijing must be in house 1 or 3
Since house 3 drinks mineral water, Beijing must be in house 1

From clue 9: Tianjin person has neighbors who love beef and are from Chengdu
This means Tianjin must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (not at ends)
Since positions 1 and 2 are Beijing and Shanghai, Tianjin must be in position 3 or 4

From clue 3: Pizza lover lives next to mineral water drinker (house 3)
So pizza lover is in house 2 or 4

From clue 17: Noodles lover drinks wine
From clue 13: Wine drinker is immediately right of tofu eater
From clue 8: Noodles lover is next to snake keeper

Working through the constraints systematically:
- House 1: Beijing, Maotai
- House 2: Shanghai
- House 3: Mineral water (center)
- House 4: 
- House 5: Fish keeper

Since Tianjin needs Chengdu and beef lover as neighbors, and considering all constraints, Tianjin must be in house 3, with Chengdu in house 4.

From clue 5: Hilton smoker is immediately left of horse breeder
From clue 11: Marlboro smoker is between Hilton and 555 smokers
From clue 18: 555 smoker is to the right of Hilton smoker

This gives us the smoking order: Hilton - Marlboro - 555

Working through all remaining constraints about colors, pets, and other attributes:
- The green house has a dog (clue 7)
- The red house drinks tea (clue 12)
- The yellow house is from Hong Kong (clue 2)

After solving all constraints, the cat must be in one of the houses. Since we know:
- House 5 has fish
- One house has a dog (green house)
- One house has a horse
- One house has a snake
- The remaining house must have the cat

Working through the complete solution, the cat lives in the yellow house.

```json
{
"color": "yellow"
}
```
