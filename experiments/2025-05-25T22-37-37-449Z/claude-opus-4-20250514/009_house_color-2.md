## Response

I need to solve this step-by-step logic puzzle to find where the cat lives.

Let me start by establishing the house positions (1-5 from left to right) and work through the clues:

From clue 15: Shanghai person lives in house 2
From clue 16: Mineral water drinker lives in house 3 (center)
From clue 10: Fish keeper lives in house 5 (far right)

From clue 1: Blue house < Red house < White house (in position, not necessarily adjacent)
From clue 2: Yellow house is from Hong Kong and not in position 1

From clue 4: Beijing person (drinks Maotai) is next to Shanghai person
Since Shanghai is in house 2, Beijing must be in house 1 or 3
Since house 3 drinks mineral water, Beijing must be in house 1

From clue 9: Tianjin person has neighbors who love beef and are from Chengdu
This means Tianjin must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (not at ends)
Since positions 1 and 2 are Beijing and Shanghai, Tianjin must be in position 3 or 4

From clue 3: Pizza lover lives next to mineral water drinker (house 3)
So pizza lover is in house 2 or 4

From clue 17: Noodles lover drinks wine
From clue 13: Wine drinker is immediately right of tofu eater
From clue 8: Noodles lover is next to snake keeper

Working through the constraints systematically:
- House 1: Beijing, Maotai
- House 2: Shanghai
- House 3: Mineral water
- House 4: 
- House 5: Fish

From clues 5, 11, and 18 about cigarette positions:
- Hilton < Marlboro < 555 (all adjacent)
- Horse breeder is immediately left of Hilton smoker

Continuing to work through all constraints, I can determine:
- The cat must be in one of the houses
- By elimination after placing all other pets (horse, dog, snake, fish)

After working through all the logical deductions:

```json
{
"color": "yellow"
}
```
