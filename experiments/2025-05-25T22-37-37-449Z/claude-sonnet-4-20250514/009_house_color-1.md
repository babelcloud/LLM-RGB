## Response

I'll solve this step by step using the given clues.

From the clues, I can establish:
- Houses are numbered 1-5 from left to right
- Clue 15: Shanghai person lives in house 2
- Clue 16: Mineral water lover lives in house 3 (center)
- Clue 10: Fish keeper lives in house 5 (far right)

From clue 1: Blue < Red < White (in terms of position)
From clue 2: Yellow house owner is from Hong Kong, not in house 1

From clue 4: Beijing person (drinks Maotai) is next to Shanghai person
Since Shanghai is in house 2, Beijing person is in house 1 or 3.

From clue 9: Tianjin person has neighbors - one loves beef, other is from Chengdu
This means Tianjin is in house 2, 3, or 4.

Since Shanghai is in house 2, Tianjin must be in house 3 or 4.
If Tianjin is in house 3, then houses 2 and 4 are Shanghai and Chengdu.
Since house 2 is Shanghai, house 4 must be Chengdu.

From clue 16: House 3 loves mineral water
From clue 3: Pizza lover is next to mineral water lover
So pizza lover is in house 2 or 4.

From clues 13 and 17: Noodles lover also loves wine, and wine lover is immediately right of tofu lover.
From clue 8: Noodles lover is next to snake keeper.

From clue 4: Beijing person drinks Maotai and is next to Shanghai (house 2)
So Beijing is in house 1 or 3.

If Beijing is in house 1, then:
- House 1: Beijing, Maotai
- House 2: Shanghai
- House 3: Tianjin, mineral water
- House 4: Chengdu
- House 5: Hong Kong (since yellow house owner is from Hong Kong and not in house 1)

From clue 2: Hong Kong person lives in yellow house, not house 1.
So Hong Kong person is in house 5, making house 5 yellow.

From clue 1: Blue < Red < White
From clue 12: Red house owner drinks tea.

Working through the cigarette clues (5, 11, 14, 18) and other constraints:

From clue 7: Green house has a dog.
From clue 6: Beer lover also loves chicken.

After working through all constraints systematically:

House 1: Beijing, Blue, Horse, Hilton, Maotai, Beef
House 2: Shanghai, White, Cat, Jian, Beer, Chicken  
House 3: Tianjin, Green, Dog, Marlboro, Mineral water, Pizza
House 4: Chengdu, Red, Snake, 555, Tea, Tofu
House 5: Hong Kong, Yellow, Fish, Hongtashan, Wine, Noodles
