## Response

To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step, focusing on the information that directly or indirectly points to the location of the cat.

1. **Initial Setup**: Clue 1 sets up the order of the red, blue, and white houses (not necessarily adjacent). Clue 2 places the yellow house (not on the far left), and its owner is from Hong Kong.

2. **Placing the Cat**: The direct clue about the cat is missing, but we know the cat's house color by process of elimination and understanding the pets' locations relative to other clues.

3. **Key Clues for Pets and Locations**:
   - Clue 5: Hilton cigarettes smoker is to the right of the horse breeder.
   - Clue 7: The person in the green house has a dog.
   - Clue 8: The person who loves noodles lives next door to the snake keeper.
   - Clue 10: The person who keeps fish lives in the house on the far right.

4. **Building the Sequence**:
   - From Clue 15, the person from Shanghai lives in the second house from the left.
   - Clue 16 places the person who loves mineral water in the center.
   - Combining Clues 3 and 16, the person who loves pizza lives next to the person who loves mineral water, indicating the pizza lover is either in the second or fourth house.

5. **Pet Locations**:
   - The fish are on the far right (Clue 10).
   - The snake keeper is next to the noodle lover (Clue 8), and since noodle lovers also love wine (Clue 17), and the wine lover is to the right of the tofu lover (Clue 13), this helps in narrowing down the snake's location.
   - The dog is in the green house (Clue 7).
   - The horse breeder is to the left of the Hilton cigarettes smoker (Clue 5).

Given the information and the process of elimination, the cat's location isn't directly stated in the clues provided, but to follow the instructions and based on typical logic puzzle structures, we would look for an omission or an indirect clue that was missed in the initial analysis. However, without a direct or clear indirect clue about the cat's house color and given the complexity and the missing direct link to the cat's location in the provided clues, a definitive answer following the exact logic and clues
