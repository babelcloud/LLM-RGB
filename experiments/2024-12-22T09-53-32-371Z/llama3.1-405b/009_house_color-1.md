## Response

To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the clues and use a process of elimination to determine the color of the house where the cat lives.

From clue 15, the person from Shanghai lives in the second house from the left. 

From clue 4, the person from Beijing lives next door to the person from Shanghai. 

Since the person from Shanghai lives in the second house, the person from Beijing must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 2, the owner of the yellow house is from Hong Kong, and their house is not on the far left. 

This means the yellow house cannot be the first house.

From clue 1, the red house is to the right of the blue house and to the left of the white house. 

Given that the person from Beijing lives in either the first or third house, if they lived in the third house, there wouldn't be enough space for the red, blue, and white houses without violating the conditions given.

Therefore, the person from Beijing must live in the first house.

Given this setup, the only configuration that works for the colors, without violating any conditions, is:

1. Blue (Beijing)
2. Yellow (Shanghai)
3. Red
4. Green
5. White

However, we need to place the cat. The cat isn't directly mentioned in relation to any of the clues about the houses' colors or the people's origins. 

But, considering all pets and their owners' possible positions based on the clues:

- The horse breeder cannot live in the green house because the person in the green house has a dog (clue 7).
- The snake keeper lives next to the person who loves noodles (clue 8), but since people who love noodles also love wine (clue 17), and the person who loves wine lives immediately to the right of the person who loves tofu (clue 13), the snake keeper's position is dependent on the wine lover's position.
- The fish keeper lives in the house on the far right (clue 10), which is the white house based on our earlier deduction.

Given the constraints and the positions of other pets and their owners, the cat, by process of elimination and fitting the remaining clues, must live in the green house, as other houses either have their pets defined or have constraints that wouldn't allow the cat based on the clues provided.

{
  "color": "green"
}
