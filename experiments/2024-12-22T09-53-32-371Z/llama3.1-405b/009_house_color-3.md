## Response

To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the color of the house where the cat lives.

From clue 15, we know the person from Shanghai lives in the second house from the left.

From clue 4, we know the person from Beijing lives next door to the person from Shanghai, so the person from Beijing lives in either the first or third house.

From clue 9, we know one immediate neighbor of the person from Tianjin loves beef, and the other immediate neighbor is from Chengdu. Since the person from Shanghai lives in the second house, the person from Tianjin cannot live in the first or second house.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the yellow house is from Hong Kong and his house is not on the far left. This means the yellow house cannot be the first house.

From clue 1, we know the red house is to the right of the blue house and to the left of the white house. Since the yellow house is not on the far left, the blue house must be the first house.

From clue 16, we know the person who loves to drink mineral water lives in the house in the center. Since there are five houses, the center house is the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who loves pizza lives next door to the person who loves mineral water. This means the person who loves pizza lives in either the second or fourth house.

From clue 12, we know the person in the red house loves to drink tea. Since the person who loves to drink mineral water lives in the third house, the person who loves to drink tea cannot live in the third house.

From clue 13, we know the person who loves to drink wine lives immediately to the right of the person who loves to eat tofu.

From clue 17, we know people who love noodles also love wine.

From clue 8, we know the person who loves noodles lives next door to the snake keeper.

From clue 7, we know the person in the green house has a dog.

Now, let's summarize what we know so far:

* Blue house: first house
* Yellow house: not first house, owner is from Hong Kong
* Red house: to the right of blue house, to the left of white house, owner loves to drink tea
* Green house: has a dog
* White house: to the right of red house

We still don't know where the cat lives. Let
