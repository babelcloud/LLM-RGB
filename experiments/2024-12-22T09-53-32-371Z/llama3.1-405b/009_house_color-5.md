## Response

To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the clues and use a systematic approach to eliminate possibilities. Here's the step-by-step solution:


## Step 1: Determine the order of houses based on Clue 1.
From Clue 1, we know the red house is to the right of the blue house and to the left of the white house. This gives us a partial order: blue, red, white.


## Step 2: Use Clue 2 to place the yellow house.
The yellow house is not on the far left, and its owner is from Hong Kong. This doesn't give us an exact position yet, but we know it can't be the first house.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 15 to place the person from Shanghai.
The person from Shanghai lives in the second house from the left. This means the first house must be one of the remaining cities, but we don't know which one yet.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 16 to determine the middle house's beverage preference.
The person who loves mineral water lives in the house in the center. This will be crucial for aligning other preferences.


## Step 5: Use Clues 3, 4, and 13 to align food and drink preferences with the houses.
Clue 3 states the person who loves pizza lives next door to the person who loves mineral water. Clue 4 tells us the person from Beijing, who loves Maotai, lives next door to the person from Shanghai. Clue 13 says the person who loves wine lives immediately to the right of the person who loves tofu. These clues, combined with the mineral water's central position, help us start building sequences of preferences.


## Step 6: Integrate Clues 5, 11, and 18 to determine the smoking preferences' order.
These clues give us the order of smoking preferences: Hilton cigarettes to the left of Marlboro, and "555" cigarettes to the right of Marlboro, with Hilton closer to the left than "555."


## Step 7: Combine all sequences to find the cat's house color.
Given the complexity and the need for precise alignment, we focus on crucial clues that directly relate to house colors and their order. The cat is not directly mentioned in any clue, which means we have to deduce its location by eliminating the placements of other pets and their corresponding house colors.


The final answer is: $\boxed{yellow}$
