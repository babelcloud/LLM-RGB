## Prompt

There is an error in the following code "Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'result'.". Please only change one line to fix the code. Generate the changed line.
export default async function(startDate:string, endDate:string) {
    const searchParams = {
        fly_from: 'HKG',
        fly_to: 'SFO',
        date_from: startDate,
        date_to: endDate,
        max_fly_duration: 24,
        curr: 'USD',
        sort: 'price',
        limit: 20
    };
    const result = await axios.get('https://api.tequila.kiwi.com/v2/search', {
        params: searchParams,
        headers: {
        'apikey': Config.KIWI_API_KEY,
        },
    })
    const result = result.data.data.map(flight => {
        return {
        price: flight.price,
        departureTime: new Date(flight.local_departure),
        arrivalTime: new Date(flight.local_arrival),
        airline: flight.airlines, // airline is an array
        flightNumber: flight.route.map(route => route.flight_no), // flightNumber is an array
        non_stop: flight.route.length === 1 // Add non_stop info to the ticket
        };
    });
    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * (flights.length + 1));
    return flights[random];
}

## Response

Let's analyze the problem in the given code. The error "Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'result'" occurs because the variable `result` is declared twice within the same scope.

The first declaration is here:
```js
const result = await axios.get('https://api.tequila.kiwi.com/v2/search', {
    params: searchParams,
    headers: {
    'apikey': Config.KIWI_API_KEY,
    },
});
```

And the second declaration is here:
```js
const result = result.data.data.map(flight => {
    //...
});
```

To fix this, we can simply reuse the already declared `result` variable instead of redeclaring it. So the line that needs to be changed is:

```js
const result = result.data.data.map(flight => {
```

The changed line should be:

```js
const processedResult = result.data.data.map(flight => {
```

Here we renamed the new variable to `processedResult` to avoid the redeclaration error and to clearly indicate that it's a modified version of the original `result`. Then in the rest of the code where `flights` is used (the line `const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * (flights.length + 1));` and `return flights[random];`), you would need to update those to use `processedResult` instead of `flights` (assuming `flights` was a typo and should have been `result` originally). So it should be something like:

```js
const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * (processedResult.length + 1));
return processedResult[random];
```
