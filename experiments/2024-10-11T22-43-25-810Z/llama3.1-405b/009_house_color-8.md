## Response

To solve this puzzle, we can deduce the color of the house where the cat lives by analyzing the given clues step by step.

## Step 1: Determine the order of houses based on Clue 1.
The red house is to the right of the blue house and to the left of the white house. This gives us a partial order: blue, red, white.

## Step 2: Use Clue 2 to place the yellow house.
The owner of the yellow house is from Hong Kong, and his house is not on the far left. This means the yellow house can be anywhere except the first position.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 15 to place the person from Shanghai.
The person from Shanghai lives in the second house from the left. This means the first house must be one of the remaining colors not yet fixed in the first position.

## Step 4: Combine information from Clues 3, 4, 16, and 17.
The person who loves pizza lives next door to the person who loves mineral water, and the person who loves mineral water lives in the center. People who love noodles also love wine, and the person who loves noodles lives next door to the snake keeper. This information helps to further restrict the possible arrangements.

## Step 5: Use Clues 5, 11, and 18 to place the smokers.
The person who smokes Hilton cigarettes lives immediately to the right of the horse breeder. The person who smokes Marlboro cigarettes lives between the person who smokes Hilton cigarettes and the person who smokes “555” cigarettes. The person who smokes “555” cigarettes lives closer to the right than the person who smokes Hilton cigarettes. This gives us a specific sequence for some of the houses.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 7 to place the green house.
The person in the green house has a dog. This clue does not directly tell us where the green house is but eliminates the green house from being the home of the cat.

## Step 7: Use Clue 10 to place the person who keeps fish.
The person who keeps fish lives in the house on the far right. This means the white house, which is to the right of the red house, cannot be the house with the fish if we follow the initial partial order. However, given the constraints, we might need to reconsider the exact positions based on all clues.

## Step 8: Re-evaluate all clues for consistency and to
