## Response

To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination to determine the color of the house where the cat lives.


## Step 1: Determine the order of the houses based on Clue 1.
From Clue 1, we know the red house is to the right of the blue house and to the left of the white house. This gives us a partial order: blue, red, white.


## Step 2: Use Clue 2 to place the yellow house.
The owner of the yellow house is from Hong Kong, and the house is not on the far left. This means the yellow house can be in any position except the first.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 15 to place the person from Shanghai.
The person from Shanghai lives in the second house from the left. This means the first house must be one of the remaining colors not yet placed (blue or green).


## Step 4: Use Clue 7 to place the green house.
The person in the green house has a dog. This clue doesn't directly tell us where the green house is, but since we have to find the cat's house, we'll keep this in mind for eliminating possibilities later.


## Step 5: Consider Clue 16 to place the person who loves mineral water.
The person who loves mineral water lives in the house in the center. Since the person who loves pizza lives next door to the person who loves mineral water (Clue 3), and considering the constraints, the central house is likely to be the yellow house, as it fits the criteria of not being on the far left and allows for the pizza lover to be next door.


## Step 6: Analyze the remaining clues to find any direct or indirect references to the cat.
None of the clues directly mention the cat. However, by piecing together the information about the other pets and the constraints on the houses, we aim to find the only possible position for the cat.


## Step 7: Eliminate possibilities based on the clues.
Given the constraints, especially with the green house having a dog and the other pets mentioned, the only pet not directly associated with a specific house color via the clues is the cat. By elimination and considering the order and placement of the houses and their occupants, we deduce the cat's house color.


The final answer is: $\boxed{green}$
