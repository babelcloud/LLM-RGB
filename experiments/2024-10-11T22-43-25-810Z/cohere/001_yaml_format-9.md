# 001_yaml_format

## Prompt

Consider the following two yaml:

```yaml
thought: I need to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_community'` error by ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.
selfCriticism: I should have verified the installation of all required dependencies before running the code.
command:
  name: runPython
  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
```

```yaml
thought: |

selfCriticism: |

command:

  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
```

THe content of the two yaml are the same, but the format is different. The "thought" and "selfCriticism" value in the second yaml is in block style which is what I want. 

I need a typescript program to check if the given yaml is in second style, if not, convert it to the second style. Code Only, no explanation.

Hint: The input yaml may not be a valid yaml, but you should convert it to the new format to make it valid.

## Response

```typescript
import * as yaml from 'js-yaml';

export function convertToBlockStyle(yamlStr: string): string {
  try {
    const doc = yaml.load(yamlStr);
    yaml.dump(doc); // This will throw an error if the YAML is not in block style
    return yamlStr; // If it doesn't throw an error, the YAML is already in block style
  } catch (error) {
    const doc = yaml.load(yamlStr, { json: true }); // Parse the YAML as JSON to handle any errors
    const blockStyleDoc = yaml.dump(doc); // Convert the parsed JSON back to YAML in block style
    return blockStyleDoc;
  }
}
```
