# 001_yaml_format

## Prompt

Consider the following two yaml:

```yaml
thought: I need to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_community'` error by ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.
selfCriticism: I should have verified the installation of all required dependencies before running the code.
command:
  name: runPython
  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
```

```yaml
thought: |

selfCriticism: |
  I should have verified the installation of all required dependencies before running the code.
command:
  name: runPython
  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
```

THe content of the two yaml are the same, but the format is different. The "thought" and "selfCriticism" value in the second yaml is in block style which is what I want. 

I need a typescript program to check if the given yaml is in second style, if not, convert it to the second style. Code Only, no explanation.

Hint: The input yaml may not be a valid yaml, but you should convert it to the new format to make it valid.

## Response

```typescript
import YAML from 'yaml';

function formatYaml(input: string): string {
  const doc = YAML.parseDocument(input);
  const thoughtNode = doc.getIn(['thought'], true);
  const selfCriticismNode = doc.getIn(['selfCriticism'], true);

  if (thoughtNode && !thoughtNode.value.includes('\n')) {
    thoughtNode.style = 'block';
  }
  if (selfCriticismNode && !selfCriticismNode.value.includes('\n')) {
    selfCriticismNode.style = 'block';
  }

  return doc.toString({ lineWidth: -1 });
}
```
