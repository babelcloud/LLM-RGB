# 001_yaml_format

## Prompt

Consider the following two yaml:

```yaml
thought: I need to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_community'` error by ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.
selfCriticism: I should have verified the installation of all required dependencies before running the code.
command:
  name: runPython
  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
```

```yaml
thought: |
  I need to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_community'` error by ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.
selfCriticism: |
  I should have verified the installation of all required dependencies before running the code.
command:
  name: runPython
  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
```

THe content of the two yaml are the same, but the format is different. The "thought" and "selfCriticism" value in the second yaml is in block style which is what I want. 

I need a typescript program to check if the given yaml is in second style, if not, convert it to the second style. Code Only, no explanation.

Hint: The input yaml may not be a valid yaml, but you should convert it to the new format to make it valid.

## Response

```typescript
import yaml from 'js-yaml';

function convertYamlStyle(input: string): string {
  const parsed = yaml.load(input) as Record<string, any>;
  
  const formatBlockStyle = (key: string) => {
    if (typeof parsed[key] === 'string') {
      parsed[key] = parsed[key].includes('\n') ? `|\n  ${parsed[key].split('\n').join('\n  ')}` : parsed[key];
    }
  };

  formatBlockStyle('thought');
  formatBlockStyle('selfCriticism');

  return yaml.dump(parsed, {
    lineWidth: -1, // Prevent line folding
    noRefs: true   // Don't use anchors and aliases
  });
}

// Example usage:
const inputYaml = `thought: I need to resolve the \`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_community'\` error by ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.
selfCriticism: I should have verified the installation of all required dependencies before running the code.
command:
  name: runPython
  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
`;

console.log(convertYamlStyle(inputYaml));
```
