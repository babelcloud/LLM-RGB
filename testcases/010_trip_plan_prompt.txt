Koshi-Tul
Koshi-Tul is a beautiful archipelago located in the tropical ocean, comprising several large islands and many smaller ones. An ancient city with many historic buildings and cultural sites can be found on the main island. The landscape of the archipelago is diverse, from golden beaches, tropical rainforests to rich coral reefs, providing abundant marine life resources. Moreover, Koshi-Tul is characterised by its hilly terrain, with the Central Highlands as one of its famous landmarks, hosting profound canyons and waterfalls.
Located near the equator, the climate is warm and humid with abundant sunshine all year round. The average temperature normally ranges between 25 to 30 degrees Celsius and remains relatively stable. Koshi-Tul islands are surrounded by deep blue, ethereal seawater. The distinct tropical vegetation and vibrant marine life are a major highlight for travelers passionate about wildlife exploration.
Koshi-Tul is a captivating, fictional island that has become a popular tourist destination in today's world. With a population of around 20,000 people, the island is home to both the native Koshians and a diverse group of immigrants, creating a unique cultural atmosphere. The official language is Koshi, which originates from the local indigenous people. However, due to the thriving tourism industry, many residents also speak fluent English, making communication easy for visitors.
The economy of Koshi-Tul relies heavily on tourism, as the island attracts a large number of visitors with its beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and tropical rainforests. In addition to tourism, the island's economy is supported by fishing, agriculture, and the production of handicrafts such as woven goods, ceramics, and wood carvings, which are highly sought after by tourists. Koshi-Tul boasts a rich cultural heritage, including unique music, dance, and art. The island's residents are passionate about celebrating various festivals, such as the Koshi-Tul Summer Music Festival, a three-day extravaganza where tourists can enjoy local folk dances, music performances, and vibrant parades.
Education is highly valued in Koshi-Tul, with the local government investing significant resources in basic education and vocational training. This ensures that the island's residents possess the professional skills and service-oriented mindset needed to cater to tourists from around the world.
Koshi-Tul is warm throughout the year, making it suitable to visit in any season. However, the dry season from June to September has relatively lower rainfall, clear weather, and stable ocean conditions, making it an ideal time for underwater activities like snorkelling and diving. Additionally, sunsets during this period are particularly magnificent, making it especially suitable for photography enthusiasts.
If you don't mind occasional tropical storms and have an interest in tropical rainforests and wildlife, the wet season at year-end (October to May of the following year) could also be a good choice. During this time, vegetational growth on the island is vigorous, and wildlife activities increase.
