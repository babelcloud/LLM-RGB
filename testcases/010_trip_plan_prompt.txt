Koshi-Tul
Koshi-Tul is a city nestled where mountains meet the sea, renowned for its beautiful natural landscapes and rich cultural traditions. Numerous islands scatter across the sea known as "The Sea of Tyul", while the city's lush mountains shimmer like emeralds under the sunlight, making Koshi-Tul visually distinct.
Koshi-Tul is a beautiful archipelago located in the tropical ocean, comprising several large islands and many smaller ones. An ancient city with many historic buildings and cultural sites can be found on the main island. The landscape of the archipelago is diverse, from golden beaches, tropical rainforests to rich coral reefs, providing abundant marine life resources. Moreover, Koshi-Tul is characterised by its hilly terrain, with the Central Highlands as one of its famous landmarks, hosting profound canyons and waterfalls.
Located near the equator, the climate is warm and humid with abundant sunshine all year round. The average temperature normally ranges between 25 to 30 degrees Celsius and remains relatively stable. Koshi-Tul islands are surrounded by deep blue, ethereal seawater. The distinct tropical vegetation and vibrant marine life are a major highlight for travelers passionate about wildlife exploration.
Koshi-Tul is warm throughout the year, making it suitable to visit in any season. However, the dry season from June to September has relatively lower rainfall, clear weather, and stable ocean conditions, making it an ideal time for underwater activities like snorkelling and diving. Additionally, sunsets during this period are particularly magnificent, making it especially suitable for photography enthusiasts.
If you don't mind occasional tropical storms and have an interest in tropical rainforests and wildlife, the wet season at year-end (October to May of the following year) could also be a good choice. During this time, vegetational growth on the island is vigorous, and wildlife activities increase.
Regardless of the season, Koshi-Tul provides unforgettable views and experiences to tourists.
